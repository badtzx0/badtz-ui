## July 2025 - Complete Site Overhaul

**We've completely rebuilt Badtz UI from the ground up.** This month brings our biggest changes yet, with a complete site overhaul and major architectural decisions that make the library faster, cleaner, and more maintainable.

### Migration to Fumadocs

We've migrated our entire documentation system to **Fumadocs**, inspired by the exceptional work done by shadcn/ui's documentation approach.

**Why Fumadocs:**
- **Better developer experience** - Cleaner, more intuitive navigation
- **Improved performance** - Faster page loads and better SEO
- **Enhanced readability** - Better typography and layout for documentation
- **Modern architecture** - Built for scalability and maintainability

The new documentation system provides a much better experience for exploring components, understanding implementation, and getting started quickly.

### TypeScript-Only Decision

We've made the strategic decision to **discontinue JavaScript support** and focus exclusively on TypeScript. This change brings significant benefits:

**Performance improvements:**
- **Cleaner codebase** - Removing dual JS/TS maintenance overhead
- **Better performance** - Optimized build processes and smaller bundles
- **Improved readability** - Especially beneficial for MDX files and documentation

**Developer benefits:**
- **Type safety** - Catch errors at development time, not runtime
- **Better IntelliSense** - Superior autocomplete and documentation in editors
- **Modern development** - Aligned with current React ecosystem standards
- **Simplified maintenance** - Single codebase to maintain and optimize

### Complete Site Redesign

The entire site has been rebuilt with a focus on clarity and performance:

- **New navigation system** - Inspired by shadcn/ui's exceptional UX patterns
- **Improved component showcase** - Better previews and implementation examples
- **Enhanced mobile experience** - Optimized for all screen sizes
- **Faster loading times** - Optimized assets and improved architecture

### MDX Optimization

With the TypeScript-only approach, our MDX files are now:

- **More performant** - Faster compilation and rendering
- **Easier to read** - Cleaner syntax without JS/TS dual support
- **Better maintained** - Single source of truth for all examples
- **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript benefits in documentation examples

### Breaking Changes

**Important:** This update includes breaking changes:

- **JavaScript support removed** - All components now require TypeScript
- **Updated installation process** - Simplified setup focused on TypeScript projects
- **New documentation structure** - Migration from old docs required

### Migration Guide

For existing users:

1. **Convert to TypeScript** - Update your project to use TypeScript
2. **Update imports** - Follow the new TypeScript-specific import patterns
3. **Review documentation** - Explore the new Fumadocs-powered site
4. **Update dependencies** - Ensure compatibility with the new architecture
