**For developers who want to skip straight to shipping.**

Badtz UI's free components are powerful, but sometimes you need more than individual components. Sometimes you need **complete sections** ready to deploy, or **entire page templates** that just work out of the box.

While you can absolutely build amazing landing pages with our free library, **Badtz UI Pro takes it to the next level** for teams and founders who want to move at light speed.

Our Pro plan gives you two key advantages:

- **Premium Blocks:** Complete, conversion-optimized sections (hero areas, pricing tables, testimonials) that you can copy and paste.
- **Full Templates:** Entire landing pages and authentication flows ready for production.

_You don't need Pro to build great things—but it definitely helps you build them faster._

## Premium Blocks: Complete Sections Ready to Ship

Every block in Badtz UI Pro is a complete, conversion-optimized section built around these principles:

- **Conversion-First Design:** Every element positioned and styled to maximize user action.
- **Proven Patterns:** Based on high-performing layouts from successful SaaS companies.
- **Copy & Deploy:** No configuration needed—just copy the code and customize your content.
- **Mobile-Optimized:** Perfect responsive behavior across all devices.
- **Performance-Ready:** Server-side rendered for optimal SEO and loading speed.

### What You Get with Premium Blocks

- **Hero Sections:** Multiple variations with different CTAs, social proof, and visual styles.
- **Pricing Tables:** Conversion-optimized layouts with psychological pricing principles.
- **Feature Grids:** Clean, scannable layouts that highlight your product benefits.
- **Testimonials:** Social proof sections designed to build trust and credibility.
- **Call-to-Actions:** High-converting CTA blocks with urgency and value proposition.

_Instead of designing and A/B testing layouts from scratch, get access to battle-tested sections that convert._

## You Don't Need Pro to Succeed

Let's be clear: **our free library is complete and powerful.** Thousands of developers build successful products using only the free components. You can create beautiful, converting landing pages without spending a penny.

**Badtz UI Pro is for those who want to skip ahead.** If you're bootstrapping or just getting started, stick with the free library—it's more than enough. If you're raising funds, have paying customers, or simply want to save weeks of development time, Pro might be worth it.
