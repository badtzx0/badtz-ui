Craft high-quality web interfaces with ready-to-use components that you can easily copy and paste into your projects.

Our 100% open-source library offers a collection of reusable components tailored for building modern, scalable, and user-friendly interfaces. Whether you're working in JavaScript or TypeScript, you can take these components and make them your own with minimal setup.

We believe that well-designed components not only enhance user experience but also contribute to a more efficient and enjoyable development process. With a focus on clarity, flexibility, and performance, our library empowers developers to build great products without worrying about reinventing the wheel.

Best of all, everything we offer is completely open-source. We’re committed to transparency and collaboration, empowering developers to learn, modify, and contribute to the library as they see fit.

Each component is thoughtfully crafted with accessibility and customization in mind, giving you the freedom to adapt them to your specific needs.

This library is designed for developers who value both quality and simplicity, offering you the building blocks to bring your vision to life—all while embracing the power of open-source innovation.
