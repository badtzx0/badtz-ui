## 📏 Code Guidelines

- **Use Prettier** for consistent code formatting.
- Follow the **existing code style** (naming, structure, etc.).
- **TypeScript:** Ensure type safety across components.
- **Use `cn` utility** for managing conditional class names where necessary.
- **Prefer `framer-motion`** for animations to maintain consistency across the library.
